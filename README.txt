JetDocs Install Profile

===============================================================================

The idea of JetDocs is to be a better starting point for web developers at
the beginning of a new project. It assembles the Drupal codebase - including
core, contrib modules and themes, and external libraries - and it performs a lot
of the initial configuration so that you can get straight onto the custom work
you need to do.

This means you can get started with projects more quickly.



INSTALLATION
============
Please see the INSTALL.txt file included with the project.


IMPROVING JETDOCS
=================
We're always looking to improve JetDocs, so please do contribute back to
the project any of the following:

1. Feedback on any clashes between modules, or particular versions of modules.
2. Any new ideas for settings we could include in the initial configuration
   that JetDocs performs.
3. Nominations for modules, themes, patches or libraries to be removed or
   added.
4. Ideas for more documentation or resources to add.

Please open a ticket, or contribute to an existing ticket, in the casetracker
at http://atc.pilotinternet.com/jetdocs. ATC stands for Air Traffic Control,
and is where we keep track of all projects.


CREDITS
=======
I studied the install profiles and makefiles of Open Atrium by Development Seed,
and Open Publish by Phase2. I also liberally borrowed code from each project.
The 'apisite' profile was also a source of inspiration and code.
Thanks go to all developers involved.
