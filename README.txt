JetDocs Install Profile

by Steve Parks (steve.parks@pilotinternet.com)

===============================================================================

JetDocs is designed to complement the 'Jet' series of install profiles for
Drupal, by providing a futher install profile that builds a local version of
the Drupal API documentation, but also including all modules within the Jet
profiles.

It can also be used standalone however, in which case it simply creates a local
version of http://api.drupal.org - which is great for doing development offline.



INSTALLATION
============
Please see the INSTALL.txt file included with the project.


IMPROVING JETDOCS
=================
We're always looking to improve JetDocs, so please do contribute back to
the project any of the following:

1. Feedback on any clashes between modules, or particular versions of modules.
2. Any new ideas for settings we could include in the initial configuration
   that JetDocs performs.
3. Nominations for modules, themes, patches or libraries to be removed or
   added.
4. Ideas for more documentation or resources to add.

Please open a ticket, or contribute to an existing ticket, in the casetracker
at http://atc.pilotinternet.com/jetdocs. ATC stands for Air Traffic Control,
and is where we keep track of all projects.


CREDITS
=======
I studied the install profiles and makefiles of Open Atrium by Development Seed,
and Open Publish by Phase2. I also liberally borrowed code from each project.
Thanks go to all developers involved.
