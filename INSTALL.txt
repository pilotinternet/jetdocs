JetDocs Install Profile for Drupal
==================================

For full details of this project, please see README.txt, or the project area at:
http://atc.pilotinternet.com/jetdocs


===== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =====

REQUIREMENTS
============
To install JetDocs you need Drush and Drush_make on your server or localhost.
Information on these projects and instructions to install them can be found at:
http://drupal.org/project/drush
http://drupal.org/project/drush_make

We also recommend using JetDocs under Aegir - using JetDocs to create a
'platform' that Aegir then manages and creates sites on.

INSTALLATION
============
Navigate to the directory where you would like to build your JetDocs platform
and run the following command:

drush make http://github.com/pilotinternet/jetdocs/raw/master/jetdocs_build.make jetdocs

alternately, you can run:
wget http://github.com/pilotinternet/jetdocs/raw/master/jetdocs_build.make

Then make any changes to the stub file you wish (eg use vanilla drupal instead
of Pressflow). Then:
drush make jetdocs_build.make jetdocs
